Week7 commands [Veer Singh]

>>> username: root
>>> password: INBMA0634L

----- KEY GENERATOR --- 

>>> ssh-keygen
automatically creates a key with defaults
PRESS ENTER 3 TIMES
2 new files are created, "id_rsa" is the private key and "id_rsa.pub" is the public key.

>>> cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa
print the private key, we can copy this and move the key from one system to another
>>> cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
prints the public key, this is shorter than the private key. We are able to generate the public key from the private key.
We use these both keys together for encryption.
Public key - Encryption
Private key - Decryption
(anyone with the public key can encrypt a message but only the person with the private key can decrypt the message)

Now we have to publish the public key and keep the private key secret.

We can create a custom key name and a custom type with the -f and -t commands respectively.
>>> ssh-keygen -f example -t RSA
>>> 1234
>>> 1234
Now we can see example and example.pub files appear which are the private and public keys.

We can make a key with no password with this commands
>>> ssh-keygen -N '' -f example -t RSA
>>> y (Since we are overwriting an already existing example key)

There is an authorised key file for every user. If another users public key is stored in a users authorised key file then that person can login as that user with the corresponding private key.
Every user has a .ssh hidden dir where this authorised key file is stored.
>>> cd .ssh
>>> ll
Right now it only has the public and private keys we generated previously
>>> cat id_rsa.pub >authorized_keys
>>> ll
We copy the contents of the public key to a new file
>>> chmod 600 authorized_keys (if this was 666 then the system will reject this authorized_keys file)
>>> ll
To test it we copy the contents of the id_rsa private key
>>> cat id_rsa
Simple highlight this in the terminal to copy everything and paste it in private.txt file on the computer
Putty cannot use this type of file format so we need to convert it, we use PuTTygen which comes with the PuTTy package.
Simple search for puttygen and open it.
Load -> Change to all files -> Navigate to private.txt -> select it -> open -> Ok (See image in main PDF)
Notice we get a public key which is the same as the public key id_rsa.pub.
Now to save this
-> Save private key -> Yes -> Filename - "new-private-key" -> Save
This will create a .ppk file which can be used by putty. (See image in main PDF)
Now to use this key to login
Open putty -> Host Name: localhost -> Port: 10022 ->Category: SSH -> Auth -> Browse -> Navigate to the .ppk file -> Open -> Open
This will open a putty terminal asking for the username, once we type "root" we will directly be logged in without the need for a password.

We cal also add multiple keys to the authorized_keys file.
>>> cat /root/example.pub >> authorized_keys
>>> vi authorized_keys
>>> :set no wrap
Using this vi command we can see now there are 2 keys and we can login via the example key as well.
>>> :q

Now we will create 3 users
>>> useradd ssh-user-1
>>> useradd ssh-user-2
>>> useradd ssh-user-3
>>> passwd ssh-user-1
>>> 1234
>>> 1234
>>> passwd ssh-user-2
>>> 1234
>>> 1234
>>> passwd ssh-user-3
>>> 1234
>>> 1234

Lets say user1 knows the password for user2 and user3 but user1 wants to login with ssh key and not password.
Open a duplicate putty session and login as user1
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh-user-1
>>>ssh-user-1>>> 1234
Now we create key
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh-keygen
PRESS ENTER 3 TIMES (to skip setting password, in practice we must set a password)

Now lets try to login to user2 from user1 with password
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost
>>>ssh-user-1>>> yes 
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
And we are able to login
>>>ssh-user-1>>> exit
We can also execute commands as another user with this method
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost id
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
Here we get the id details of user2

Now we will configure user2 so that user1 can login via ssh without password (while having the ssh private key)
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost 'mkdir .ssh'
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost 'chmod 700 .ssh'
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost 'cat >>.ssh/authorized_keys ' < .ssh/id_rsa_pub
NOTE: the first .ssh is the .ssh dir inside user2 and the second .ssh is the .ssh dir inside user1. Here we are copying the contents of the public key of user1 to the authorized_keys of user2
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost 'chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys'
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
NOW we do not need password everyime
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost id
It simply works since the public key of user1 is in authorized_keys of user2

If we have multiple keys then we use the "i" command to specify which key we are Using
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa ssh-user-2@localhost id
This works but if we have another key and we use that key it will not work since its public key is not in the user2 authorized_keys yet.
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh-keygen
>>>ssh-user-1>>> other-key
PRESS ENTER 2 TIMES
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh -i other-key ssh-user-2@localhost id
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
This time we are again asked for the password
We can add the public key of other-key so it works without password
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-2@localhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys' <other-key.pub
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh -i other-key ssh-user-2@localhost id

There is a simpler way to do this
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh-copy-id ssh-user-3@localhost
>>>ssh-user-1>>> password: 1234
Now we can execute any commands on user3 as user1 using ssh
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-3@localhost find
>>>ssh-user-1>>> ssh ssh-user-3@localhost 'ls -la'

---------PRACTICE -----
TURN OFF VIRTUALMACHINE, DELETE IT AND MAKE A NEW ONE AND CONFIGURE REMOTE ACCESS

Open PuTTygen -> Generate -> Key passphrase: 1234 -> Confirm passphrase: 1234 -> Save private key -> filename "private-key-for-veer" -> Save
As we can see the we are seeing a public key in the puttygen window. This is the public key for veers private key.

Now headless start on the new virtual machine and connect to putty
>>> username: root
>>> password: INBMA0634L

Create a new user veer and configure the users ssh
>>> useradd veer
>>> mkdir /home/veer/.ssh
>>> chmod 700 /home/veer/.ssh/
>>> stat /home/veer/.ssh/
>>> chown veer:veer /home/veer/.ssh/
>>> stat /home/veer/.ssh/
We create the .ssh file and change its rights to 700. Then we see that its owner is currently root so we change the owner to veer.
Now we need to copy the public key so we go to puttygen and copy the public key from there. We paste it into the authorized_keys
>>> cat >>/home/veer/.ssh/authorized_keys
NOW PASTE THE PUBLIC KEY HERE 
PRESS ENTER AND CTRL+D TO SAVE 
>>> cat /home/veer/.ssh/authorized_keys
We can see the contents of authorized_keys and we see the public key is here.

>>> stat /home/veer/.ssh/authorized_keys
Now we see that the owner is root and permissions is 644 so we change that to owner veer and permissions 600
>>> chown veer:veer /home/veer/.ssh/authorized_keys
>>> chmod 600 /home/veer/.ssh/authorized_keys
>>> stat /home/veer/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now we login as veer using the private key
Open putty -> Host Name: localhost -> Port: 10022 -> Category -> SSH -> Auth -> Browse -> Navigate to the "private-key-for-veer" and select it -> Open -> Categor -> Data -> Auto-login username -> veer -> Open 
This will open a new putty terminal, we will be logged in as veer, authenticated with the private key, the system now asks us the passphrase we set when we generated the private key
>>>veer>>> password: 1234
And we are able to login as veer.

>>> passwd -S veer
>>> grep veer /etc/shadow
We see that the password is locked for veer and veer doesnt have a password which means the user veer cannot login via a password

lets say we set an expiration date for the user account veer
>>> chage -E 2021-01-01 veer
>>> chage -l veer
Now if we duplicate the veer putty session
>>>veer>>> password: 1234
The window closes automatically since the account already expired on Jan 2 2021.

>>> chage -M 10 veer
>>> chage -d 2021-01-01 veer
>>> chage -E -1 veer
>>> chage -l veer
Now we change the max number of days b/w password change to 10, change last password change date to Jan 1 2021, change the expiration to never.
Now try to connect to putty with veer using ssh key.
Open putty -> Host Name: localhost -> Port: 10022 -> Category -> SSH -> Auth -> Browse -> Navigate to the "private-key-for-veer" and select it -> Open -> Categor -> Data -> Auto-login username -> veer -> Open 
This will open a new putty terminal, we will be logged in as veer, authenticated with the private key, the system now asks us the passphrase we set when we generated the private key
>>>veer>>> password: 1234
Now the system tells us to change the password
NOTE: even tho veer doesnt have a password, the password settings using "chage" affect it.

CLOSE ALL PUTTY TERMINALS

---------Logging in without knowing system password with physical access to the system-----------
Remove the last virtual machine and import a new one. Start this new vm in normal mode, as soon as the boot screen appears use the top or bottom array key to pause it, here we see 2 options for CentOS Stream (shown as an image in main PDF)
Select the first option and press the 'e' key to enter config file editor. (Keep in mind since we are using the vm directly it captures the mouse and keyboard and we need to press the default key 'right control' to free the mouse and keyboard, we can set this key to anything in the virtualbox settings)
We need to edit this file, in the 5th line, before "ro" we need to add "rd.break" which breaks the boot process and forces us to use the emergency rescue system.(Shown as image in main PDF) Press control+x to start with the new settings. This opens the rescue system and we can use this to use this computer. (Note: not all operating systems have this)
>>> ls -la
(Show as an image in main PDF)
Notice not all files are available, like sda1, we can use the mount command to see where it is
>>> mount
We see that it is in the /sysroot directly, this contains the files to overwrite the password
>>> cat /sysroot/etc/shadow
>>> mount -o remount,rw /sysroot/
>>> mount 
Now we are able to write any file in the root directory
>>> chroot /sysroot/
>>> ls -la
Now we are able to use the passwd command to change the password of root
>>> passwd
>>> 1234
>>> 1234
>>> touch /.autorelabel
>>> exit
>>> reboot
Now the machine we restart, again on boot use the top or bottom arrow keys. Select the first option and enter. (This will take some time, it will also reboot once)
>>> username: root
>>> password: 1234

This is why it is very important to encrypt sensitive data since anyone with physical access can change the root password and login to the machine.
